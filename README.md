# Adventure_Cycles_Sales_Project

## Overview

This Cycle_Sales Project contains the sales dashboard analysis covering key performance metrics such as total revenue, quantity sold, return quantity, unique customers, and detailed geographical and product-level insights. The data presented helps provide a clear picture of sales performance over the reporting period.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Acquisition

The project begins with the acquisition of raw sales data. This data may include information such as customer , product details, sales for 3 years, and territories. Data can be obtained from various sources, including databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

### 2. Data Transformation with Power BI

The data transformation process in Power BI involves cleaning, reshaping, and optimizing data to ensure it is ready for analysis and visualization.Below is an overview of the transformation steps taken:
  1. Loading Data: Imported data from the source file (CSV) into Power BI.
  2. Power Query Editor: Utilized Power Query Editor to perform transformations.
  3. Data Transformation: Adjusted the structure of the dataset by splitting or merging columns where necessary. 

### 3. Data Modeling

Once the data is prepared, structuring data to establish relationships between different tables and optimize it for analysis. This may include:
  1. Defining Relationships: Establish connections between tables based on common fields (e.g., Customer ID, Product ID) using primary and foreign keys. These relationships allow for combining data from different 
     tables.
  2.  Creating Calculated Columns and Measures: Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom calculations, such as totals, percentages, and running totals, directly within the model.

### 4. Power BI Visualization

Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:

- Bar charts and pie charts displaying sales by product category.
- Time series charts illustrating sales trends.
- Geographic maps showing the distribution of restaurant locations.
- Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
